# TERMINAL TODO

**Author:** Christopher R. Hill

This project is sloppy and all functions and logic exist in main.js. 

I just wanted my own todo app that I could manage in my terminal, so I made this.

# Usage 

* Obviously, but here: 

    * ```node main.js```
* Use arrow keys to move between todo items.
* Press "+" key to add an item 
* Press "-" key to remove an item
